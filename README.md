# docker-ejabberd

[Ejabberd][ejabberd] server version 14.07 with internal and anonymous auth enabled and no SSL, thats all. To control the XMPP server, register an admin user 'admin@\<domain\>' with your prefered XMPP client. You can change the default domain `localhost` and other settings through environment variables.

[ejabberd]: http://ejabberd.im

## Usage

### Run in foreground

```
$ docker run -i -P rroemhild/ejabberd
```

### Run in background

```
$ docker run -d -i -p 5222:5222 -p 5269:5269 -p 5280:5280 rroemhild/ejabberd
```

### Run using fig

```yaml
xmpp:
  image: rroemhild/ejabberd
  environment:
    ERL_OPTIONS: "-noshell" # Avoid attaching a shell, which requires STDIN to be attached, which `fig up` does not do. See https://github.com/docker/fig/issues/480.
```

## Using docker-ejabberd as base image

The image is called `rroemhild/ejabberd` and is available on the Docker registry.



```
FROM rroemhild/ejabberd
ADD ./ejabberd.yml.tpl /opt/ejabberd/conf/ejabberd.yml.tpl
```

If you need root privileges switch to `USER root` and go back to `USER ejabberd` if you're done.

## Environment variables / Runtime configuration

You can additionally provide extra runtime configuration in a downstream image by replacing the config template `ejabberd.yml.tpl` with one based on this image's template and include extra interpolation of environment variables. The template is parsed by Jinja2 with the runtime environment (equivalent to Python's `os.environ` available as `env`).

### XMPP domain

By default the container will serve the XMPP domain `localhost`. In order to serve a different domain at runtime, provide the `XMPP_DOMAIN` variable as such:

```
$ docker run -i -P -e "XMPP_DOMAIN=foo.com" rroemhild/ejabberd
```

### Loglevel

By default the loglevel is set to INFO (4). To set another loglevel provide the `LOGLEVEL` variable as such:

```
$ docker run -i -P -e "LOGLEVEL=5" rroemhild/ejabberd
```

```
loglevel: Verbosity of log files generated by ejabberd.
0: No ejabberd log at all (not recommended)
1: Critical
2: Error
3: Warning
4: Info
5: Debug
```

### Erlang node

By devault the erlang node is set to localhost. If you want so set the erlang node to the hostname provide the `ERLANG_NODE` variable such as:

```
$ docker run -i -P -e "ERLANG_HOST=true" rroemhild/ejabberd
```

### Erlang cookie

By default the erlang cookie is generated by every image build and is static at this stage. To set your own cookie provide the `ERLANG_COOKIE` variable such as:

```
$ docker run -i -P -e "ERLANG_COOKIE=YOURERLANGCOOKIE" rroemhild/ejabberd
```
